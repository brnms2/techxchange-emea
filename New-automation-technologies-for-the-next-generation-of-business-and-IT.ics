URL:https://www.ibm.com/community/ibm-techxchange-conference/
DESCRIPTION:From the printing press to the robotic assembly line\, each advancement in automation has improved our quality of life and freed up employees to do higher value work. The current generation of automation leverages AI to perform activities that canâ€™t be performed at human scale\, such as helping customer service calculate in real time the probability of customer churn or recommending a way to optimize AWS resources for performance and cost. The new generation of AI-driven automation will empower business teams to better engage customers and employees\, as well as to optimize cost across the entire hybrid cloud environment. Join Madhu Kochar\, VP of Product Development\, to learn how breakthrough automation technologies leverage conversational AI\, Kafka event streams\, and AI-driven optimization to meet these challenges and empower the next generation of business and IT.\n\nMadhu Kochar\nVice President\, Product Development\, IBM Automation\, IBM\n\nMGM Grand\, Las Vegas\, NV\nGrand Ballroom 115 & 120\, Level 1\n\nJoin the Live Stream: https://www.ibm.com/community/ibm-techxchange-conference/
